During the visualization, you might think that there are better algorithms than the others because they are animated faster in less Animation Time, but this is incorrect. The real indicator for efficiency is the Operations Counter indicator, which counts how many operations the algorithm was required to perform during its progress. The reason for the differences in the animation time is that there are algorithms that swap between items many times during their run. on dry (without animation), swap items in an array is a Constant Time operation ( O(1) ), but in animation terms, it isn’t the case. The browser needs to repaint the swapped items. This action is an ‘expensive’ one, and therefore – longer animation time.
